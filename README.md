This repository contains data and scripts needed to reproduce the figures from the review article by
J.Hunt, E.Vasiliev, "Milky Way dynamics in light of Gaia".

For Figure 2 (major spectroscopic surveys including Gaia RVS), the data files are hosted separately on Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14609059)
and need to be downloaded and placed into the folder "fig2" before running the script.

For Figure 5 astroNN is available at https://data.sdss.org/sas/dr17/env/APOGEE_ASTRO_NN/

For Figure 6 the UMS and Cepheid plots are available directly through a tutorial notebook from Poggio et al. (2021a) at https://github.com/epoggio/Spiral_arms_EDR3. The open cluster data from Hunt & Reffert (2023) is available at https://cdsarc.cds.unistra.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/673/A114#/browse

Figure's 7,8,9,10,12,13,14 are created from a subset of the Gaia DR3 RVS data with added action variables from Adrian Price-Whelan using gala. The file is available at Zenodo (https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.14609059) as GaiaDR3 and must be downloaded spearately.
